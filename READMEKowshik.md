This ToDO was found in the ProductsPage.tsx

  /*
    TODO:
      When the drag ends we want to keep the status persistant across logins. 
      Instead of modifying the data locally we want to do it serverside via a post
      request
  */


  Since the README.md file did not say anything regarding this TODO, I ignored it



  Removed ProducctStatus from the front end because we are only displaying the active product and it seems that
  there is no need to keep inactive product. So there is no point in keeping ProductStatus since all products sent
  by the backend will be active


  //changed Product --> ProductProps in interface. Is that okay?
